								<h2>Comparing SFML with Unreal</h2>
								<p>I was tasked with creating a complex fire partilce system in a game engine (i choose Unreal). This fire system needed to spread across certain object types 
									only and at different rates. The fire may also change in size and colour to which object its burning on.

								<h2>2D DirectX 11 Game Engine for Worms2D</h2>
								<p>I had a choice between doing "game play programming" or "game engine programming". I choose game engine because graphics programming 
									is where my interests are most at. I had previously played with OpenGL but this was the first time i had used DirectX. We were provided
									with a bare bones graphics engine and the DirectX toolkit. I had to familarise my self with the code and extend it so it became a game engine 
									specifc for worms 2D. We were in a group of 3.

								<h2>C++ Projects</h2>
								<p>C++ is the main language we used. There was a framework called ASGE which was a simple 2D graphics framework for creating sprites and getting
									user input. We used this to create a number of games across the two years which got more complex and included maths, networking and team work.

								<h3>The Shining</h3>
								<p>In a group of 4 we were given a theme of the film called "The Shining". We had to design a game and pitch it to our peers.
									Then we were given feedback from everyone to which we improved our game. Then we went ahead and built it.
								</p>
								<p>Here is a short clip of it...</p>

								<h3>Tanks Multiplayer</h3>
								<p>In a group of 4 we were tasked with creating a RPG(role-playing game) game that included netwroking for up to 4 players.
									We used TCP Host/Client, where one person hosts and 1-3 people may be clients.
								</p>
								<p>Here is a short clip of it...</p>

								<h3>Space Invaders</h3>
								<p>I was tasked with creating space invaders with different modes. These different modes where how the aliens moved down the screen.
									One was the original style game. Another was a constant gravity. Another was a curved tragectory and the last is using sin and cos.
